       <p>Welcome to Emmanuel's Final Project page, Thanks for visiting!
       <br>I created this game becuase over the course of the semester I grew an interested in making games and designing them.
       <br>I was also inspired by my brother who is a computer engineer! taking on a challenge such as this; I'm proud to say that I did it!  
       <br>My program is a single player 2D Runner Game, player is a styling of my emoji.
       <br>As the main character the objective is to score 100 points, 3 points are earned every time the user jumps and lands safely or jumps over an obstacle.
       <br>If the user collides with the obstacle, 1 point is subtracted.
       <br>To jump over obstacles, the user must press or hold the space bar
       <br>To pause and or play the game while the game is already started, press the play/pause button at the top of the screen
       <br>The game continues until you win, after you have won press restart to play again
       <br>Let's see if you can overcome all 100 obstacles!
       <br>Thank you and enjoy playing my fun and addicting game :)</p>
